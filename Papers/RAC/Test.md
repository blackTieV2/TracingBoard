### Introduction

Respected Chairman of Acacia, M.E.Comp. KM Venkatachalam, dignitaries on and off the dais, M.E. Companions, E. Companions, and Companions all!  

I thank the Management Committee of Acacia for giving me this opportunity to share my thoughts on the Holy Royal Arch, the essence of Freemasonry. When I was "exalted" in Chapter Discovery No.2, SGCI on 2nd March 1999 by M.E.Comp. Capt. Dr. B. Biswakumar, PIGP, PG Supdt., it felt like an epiphany! The glorious colors and shapes I witnessed left an indelible impression on my mind.

Since that day, I have attended countless Royal Arch convocations, occupied the First Principal’s Chair six times, and helped exalt numerous candidates. The charm of this Order has only increased over time because of its profound mysticism and philosophy.

### The Hidden Mysteries of the Holy Royal Arch

In this paper, I will attempt to expound on some of the hidden mysteries beautifully interwoven into the Holy Royal Arch. This is not a definitive treatise but merely my humble attempt to understand, appreciate, and explain some of its inherent truths.

W.Bro. WL Wilmshurst, in his book *"The Meaning of Masonry"*, said:

> "The higher degrees...illustrate truths of much interest and often set forth with impressive ceremonial beauty...the only secrets worth the name...are those...which discover themselves within the personal consciousness of the seeker."

### Four Distinct Features of the Holy Royal Arch

**1. Only a Master Mason can be exalted.**  
No one can be received into the Holy Royal Arch without first being a Master Mason. As Wilmshurst eloquently puts it:  
> "As an unborn physical infant can know nothing of this world...the spiritual child cannot be born into conscious function upon the plane of the Spirit until it has become entirely detached from the carnal matrix."  

**2. The descent of the letter 'G'.**  
In the Second Degree, the letter "G" symbolized the Great Architect of the Universe. By the Third Degree, it had descended to guide the candidate toward the light of a Master Mason. In the Royal Arch, it rests at the chequer-work floor, bearing the Sacred Name TTALGMH.

**3. The Assembly of Nine Officers.**  
The Assembly is now composed of nine officers, grouped in triads, reflecting the tripartite aspects of the Companion.

**4. The Re-designation from Lodge to Chapter.**  
The word "Chapter" derives from *Caput* or "head," symbolizing the candidate's sublimation of their lower nature to achieve union with the Universal Spirit.

### The Symbolism of the Triangle

The triangle is a recurring symbol in the Royal Arch. From the jewels and aprons to the layout of the lights and the altar, it represents the candidate’s spiritual, psychical, and physical parts, all equalized around their common Life-Principle. The three triadic aspects are ceremonially personified by the nine officers of the Chapter.

### The Hailing Sign and the Chakras

The hailing sign of the Royal Arch can be correlated to the 'Sahasra' chakra, symbolizing the pituitary gland. This gesture reflects the control point for the exaltation of the mortal into a more developed soul.

---

### The Sacred and Mysterious Name

As the ceremony progresses, the Three Principals form triangles to exchange the Sacred and Mysterious Name, TTALGMH. This act reflects the recurring themes of the numbers 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 12 within the Royal Arch.

---

### The Platonic Bodies

The Platonic Bodies, representing the five elements (fire, air, earth, water, and an astral element), are central symbols within the Chapter. Each shape—tetrahedron, octahedron, cube, icosahedron, and dodecahedron—holds profound significance, reflecting the elements' interaction with the divine.

---

### The Journey of the Candidate

The candidate's journey from West to East, symbolized by the seven symbolic steps, parallels the journey taken in the Craft Degrees. Along the way, the candidate encounters the vibrant ensigns and implements of labor, representing deeper spiritual truths.

---

### Conclusion

The Royal Arch, as the natural culmination of the Master Mason Degree, exemplifies the transition from "He suffered and was buried and rose again" to "He ascended into Heaven." The discovery of the Lost Word, representing the divine root of the candidate's being, marks the conclusion of the Ceremony of Exaltation.

The candidate, having passed through the ark of redemption, reaches the presence of the Great I AM, the Alpha and Omega, the First and the Last.

**Amen! Amen! Amen!**
